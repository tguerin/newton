/// The `Restitution` extension type represents a restitution value, often referred to as the "bounciness"
/// of a material, on a scale from `0` (no bounce) to values greater than `1` (hyper-bouncy).
///
/// This extension type implements the `double` interface, making it usable wherever a `double` is expected.
/// It provides several predefined restitution values, ranging from no bounce at all to the legendary
/// bounciness of Flubber.
///
/// You can also create custom restitution values using the `Restitution.custom()` factory constructor.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ```dart
/// final r1 = Restitution.basketball;
/// final r2 = Restitution.custom(0.75);
/// print('Restitution: ${r1.value}'); // Output: Restitution: 0.6
/// print('Custom Restitution: ${r2.value}'); // Output: Custom Restitution: 0.75
/// ```
