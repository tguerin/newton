## Particle Emitter for Flutter

Newton is a highly configurable particle emitter package for Flutter, now with advanced support for both deterministic and physics-based animations. With Newton, you can create captivating animations such as rain, smoke, explosions, and more, along with realistic physics-driven effects like gravity and collisions. This allows you to easily add both visually stunning and physically accurate effects to your Flutter applications, enhancing the user experience with dynamic and interactive animations.

### Features

- **Highly Configurable:** Newton offers an extensive range of options to fine-tune your particle animations. You can adjust particle appearance, behavior, movement, and physics properties, providing complete control over your animations.

- **[Interactive Animation Configurator](https://newton.7omtech.fr/docs/configurator):** Create your particle animations visually using the included app configurator. Experiment with different settings, preview animations in real-time, and easily copy-paste the generated code into your project. *(Note: Chaining animations will be supported in future versions.)*

- **Custom Particle Design:** Design your particle effects to seamlessly integrate with your appâ€™s aesthetic. Use custom shapes, colors, and sizes to craft truly unique animations that suit your needs.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed guides and examples are available to help you easily create popular particle effects like rain, smoke, and explosions.

- **Efficient Performance:** Newton is optimized for performance, ensuring smooth animations even on lower-end devices without compromising on visual quality.


## Installation

To use Newton, simply add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  newton_particles: ^0.2.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## Usage

1. Import the Newton package:

```dart
import 'package:newton_particles/newton_particles.dart';
```

2. Create a `Newton` widget and add it to your Flutter UI with the desired effects:

```dart
Newton(
    // Add any kind of effects to your UI
    // For example:
    activeEffects: [
        RelativisticEffectConfiguration(
            gravity: Gravity.earthGravity,
            maxAngle: 90,
            maxEndScale: 1,
            maxFadeOutThreshold: .8,
            maxOriginOffset: const Offset(1, 0),
            maxParticleLifespan: const Duration(seconds: 10),
            minVelocity: Velocity.stationary,
            maxVelocity: Velocity.stationary,
            minAngle: 90,
            minParticleLifespan: const Duration(seconds: 7),
            minEndScale: 1,
            minFadeOutThreshold: .6,
            origin: Offset.zero,
            particleConfiguration: const ParticleConfiguration(
                shape: CircleShape(),
                size: Size(5, 5),
            ),
        ),
    ],
)
```

Try our [effect configurator](https://newton.7omtech.fr/docs/configurator) to tweak your effect.

## Example

For a quick start, here's an example of creating a simple rain effect using Newton:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:newton_particles/newton_particles.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Newton Rain Example')),
        body: Newton(
          activeEffects: [
            RelativisticEffectConfiguration(
              gravity: Gravity.earthGravity,
              maxAngle: 90,
              maxEndScale: 1,
              maxFadeOutThreshold: .8,
              maxOriginOffset: const Offset(1, 0),
              maxParticleLifespan: const Duration(seconds: 10),
              minVelocity: Velocity.stationary,
              maxVelocity: Velocity.stationary,
              minAngle: 90,
              minParticleLifespan: const Duration(seconds: 7),
              minEndScale: 1,
              minFadeOutThreshold: .6,
              origin: Offset.zero,
              particleConfiguration: const ParticleConfiguration(
                shape: CircleShape(),
                size: Size(5, 5),
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
