# Why Newton?


Welcome to **Newton**, a library created with the goal of making it effortless to build stunning, unique animations. Newton empowers developers to go beyond common visual effects, enabling you to create new and engaging interactions for your users. My vision for Newton was simple: to allow you to build amazing animations purely through configuration, without needing to implement complex logic.

With Newton, you can easily design animations like single-point or multi-point particle emission, leveraging a flexible and highly configurable system. Whether you're looking for captivating visual effects or unique particle behavior, Newton gives you the freedom to experiment and innovate.

Why the name Newton? I considered naming it “Einstein”, but since the first version of the library focused on deterministic animations—where outcomes are predictable and consistent—**Newton** felt like a more fitting tribute to the deterministic laws of physics. Now, with the addition of physics-based animations, the name still represents the balance between predictable and dynamic effects.

I invite you to explore the **[Animation Configurator](/docs/configurator)**—a tool that allows you to fine-tune particle effects and generate ready-to-use code. Plus, if you create custom animations, feel free to share them! I'd be happy to showcase them on the website.

Be sure to check out the **[Effect Samples](/docs/presets)** section, where I provide detailed instructions on how to create popular particle effects like rain, smoke, and explosions using Newton. This section will help you design your own custom animations, allowing you to fully leverage the power of the library.

So jump in, try out the [configurator](/docs/configurator), and craft animations that will leave a lasting impression on your users.
